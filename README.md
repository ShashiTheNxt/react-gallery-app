# react-gallery-app
This React app fetches images from Flickr based on user tags. The `App` component uses Axios to fetch up to 24 images per query. User input triggers re-renders, displaying images in a `Gallery` component with a grid layout. CSS styles enhance the interface, including custom headings and image appearance.
